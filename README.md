# chatgpt_classifficator

Content classificator for classification of the content into different classes for using as a remote function in BigQuery

## Why

I had a client who wanted to see how his landing pages were performing and he wanted to evaluate per content classes. Since it was not possible to categorise the content with any structure or tags I've offerd to use an AI for that. This example is build on ChatGPT but one can use any natural language AI. There are enough on the market.
